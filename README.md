Schematics and firmware for analog line level audio router/switchbox.

When You have some number of older audio gear then inputs count of power amplifier comes an issue. 
It would be nice to have some kind of switchbox for RCA inputs. There is not something like that in
the market, so i'm building one by myself. With blackjack!
